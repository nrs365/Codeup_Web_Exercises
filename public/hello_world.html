		<h2>One of my favorite quotes:</h2>
		<blockquote>"One of the few things left in the world, <em>aside from the world itself</em>, that saddens me every day is an awareness that you get upset if Boo Boo or Walt tells you you're saying something that sounds like me. You sort of take it as an accusation of piracy, a <em>little slam at your individuality.</em> Is it so <em>bad</em> that we sometimes sound like each other? The membrane is so thin between us. Is it so important for us to keep in mind which is whose? ... For us, doesn't each of our individualities begin right at the point where we own up to our extremely close connections and accept the inevitability of borrowing one another's jokes, talents, idiocies? You notice I don't include neckties...<br>It must be terrible for you to think I have neckties and things on my mind besides your story. I don't. <em>I'm just looking everywhere for my thoughts</em>... <br>About the only thing that saves my neck when I get to feeling this way is that <strong>guilt is an imperfect form of knowledge.</strong> Just because it isn't perfect doesn't mean it can't be used...<br> You know it's mostly pride that's keeping me up. I think that's my main worry. For your own sake, <em>don't make me proud of you</em>. I think that's exactly what I'm trying to say. <strong>If only you never keep me up again out of pride.</strong> Give me a story that makes me feel unreasonably vigilant. Keep me up till five only because <em>all your stars are out, and for no other reason</em>... <br><strong>I think tonight that anything you say to a writer after you beg him to let his stars come out is just literary advice...</strong><br> You wrote down that you were a writer by profession. It sounded to me like the loveliest euphemism I had ever heard. When was writing your profession? <em>It's never been anything but your religion</em>.<br>Never... Since it is your religion, do you know what you will be asked when you die? ... I'm sure you'll only get asked two questions. <em>Were most of your stars out? Were you busy writing your heart out?</em> If only you knew how easy it would be for you to say yes to both questions... <strong>You just shamelessly sit down and write the thing yourself</strong>... Trust your heart. You're a deserving craftsman. <em>It would
		 never betray you</em>... <br>I think I'd give almost anything on earth to see you writing a something, an anything, a story, a poem, a tree, that was <strong><em>really and truly after your own heart.</em></strong>" - Seymour - An Introduction</blockquote>
